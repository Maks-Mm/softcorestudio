Got it! Here’s a **structured roadmap / plan for your next job day**, focusing on integrating **API auth to Navbar buttons** and **Dashboard access** without diving into code.

---

## **📅 Next Job Day Plan: API Auth Integration**

### **Goal**

* Integrate Firebase/Google authentication for **Sign In / Sign Up buttons** in Navbar.
* Enable **Dashboard access** only for authenticated users.
* Prepare a scalable structure for future authentication features.

---

### **1️⃣ Morning: Preparation & Setup (1.5–2h)**

1. Review current Navbar structure and buttons.
2. Check existing Firebase project configuration:

   * Firebase console: Auth enabled (Google, Email/Password).
   * Google Cloud Console: OAuth credentials set.
3. Prepare environment variables for Firebase (API keys, project ID).
4. Plan authentication flow:

   * Unauthenticated → Sign In / Sign Up
   * Authenticated → Dashboard / Logout

---

### **2️⃣ Late Morning: Firebase Integration Planning (1–1.5h)**

1. Decide on a **single source of truth** for user auth state.
2. Map out **hooks or context** for managing auth state in Navbar and other components.
3. Plan **conditional rendering** in Navbar for:

   * Logged-out state → Sign In / Sign Up
   * Logged-in state → Dashboard / Logout

---

### **3️⃣ Early Afternoon: Auth Actions & Button Integration (1–1.5h)**

1. Define the actions for authentication:

   * Sign In (Google / Email)
   * Sign Up (Google / Email)
   * Logout
2. Connect these actions to Navbar buttons.
3. Test each action in isolation to confirm it works with Firebase.

---

### **4️⃣ Mid Afternoon: Dashboard Access Control (1–1.5h)**

1. Define rules for accessing the Dashboard:

   * Only authenticated users can enter.
   * Unauthenticated users redirected to login or home page.
2. Plan how to pass the auth state to the Dashboard component.
3. Map out **future scalability** for roles or permissions.

---

### **5️⃣ Late Afternoon: Testing & QA (1–2h)**

1. Test all Navbar buttons for logged-in and logged-out scenarios.
2. Test Dashboard access protection.
3. Validate auth state persists on page refresh.
4. Make notes for next improvements:

   * Multi-provider auth (Facebook, GitHub, etc.)
   * Token management for API calls
   * Error handling and notifications

---

### **6️⃣ Wrap-Up**

1. Document workflow and any edge cases discovered.
2. Commit changes and prepare a short summary for the team or mentor.
3. Set next-day goals: add additional providers, implement server-side auth, or role-based access.

If you want, I can also make a **visual timeline chart for the day**, so you can follow it hour by hour like a proper roadmap. It makes it much easier to stay on track. Do you want me to do that?
